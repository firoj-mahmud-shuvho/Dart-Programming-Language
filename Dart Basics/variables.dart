/*Variables are containers used to store value in the program. There are different types of variables where you can keep different kinds of values.
String: For storing text value. E.g. “John” [Must be in quotes]
int: For storing integer value. E.g. 10, -10, 8555 [Decimal is not included]
double: For storing floating point values. E.g. 10.0, -10.2, 85.698 [Decimal is included]
num: For storing any type of number. E.g. 10, 20.2, -20 [both int and double]
bool: For storing true or false. E.g. true, false [Only stores true or false values]
var: For storing any value. E.g. ‘Bimal’, 12, ‘z’, true*/
